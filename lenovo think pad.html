Budget laptops get no glory and ones made for business, even less so. But, they're the ones a lot of us buy for day-to-day tasks at the office, at home or at school, so when a good one comes around, you know it because it stands out from the crowd. The Lenovo ThinkPad 13 is just that: a budget-friendly standout.The ThinkPad 13 might not go above and beyond for performance with its entry-level components. It's really the overall design including an excellent ThinkPad keyboard -- and features are better than you might expect, giving you something more than good enough.<p>
There is a small touchpad, too, with support for multitouch gestures. You might end up turning some of the gestures off though, in particular pinch to zoom. All too often I would accidentally resize whatever I was working in.If you're planning 
to connect to external displays or hard drives, a keyboard and mouse or anything else, it won't be a problem. There are three USB 3.0 ports (one on the left, two on the right), a full-size HDMI port and a USB-C port that can be used for peripherals as well as power. There's also a Lenovo OneLink+ port for use with the company's $180 dock with support for two external displays and much more, though the reviews on the product page are mixed.<br>
