The history of 17-inch gaming laptops is a never-ending story of embarrassingly thick slabs of plastic and metal, typically done up in garish colors, covered in enough lights for a planetarium show, and designed to appeal to a visual aesthetic somewhere between '90s cyberpunk chic and a dorm room.<br>
No matter that these systems have become steadily more powerful over the years, slowly closing the gap with traditional gaming desktops. For many who enjoy PC gaming but also want a laptop that actually works for everyday tasks without looking ridiculous, solutions have been few and far between.<br>
MSI produces laptop bodies that other boutique PC makers use to build made-to-order systems, and you're likely to see something similar to this model tagged with other brand names. But the version MSI sells, called the GS70 Stealth, is a great example of the new slimmer, more modern-looking gaming laptop we're starting to see more of. <br>
