The first laptop I ever bought with my own money was a Dell Inspiron. It was big, ugly, and exactly what I needed at the time -- a cheap computer with just enough processing power to play the latest Half-Life game.The new Dell Inspiron 15 7000 is my college laptop on steroids.It's a cheap 15-inch laptop that can run any game on the market. And, just like my old notebook, it's a clunker with an utterly forgettable design. But that melts away when you realize this inch-thick obelisk can play the most demanding games, including Fallout 4, Grand Theft Auto V and The Witcher 3, albeit with graphical detail settings at low. Slightly older games like Bioshock Infinite ran better.<br>
The secret is Nvidia's GeForce 960M graphics chip, a prime piece of silicon that's only typically found in computers that cost hundreds of dollars more. While some of those computers have sleeker bodies, Dell chose to make an affordable gaming laptop instead. And though Dell may have cut a few corners to get to that magic $800 price, I couldn't find any major deal-breakers when I made it my primary computer for weeks at a time.<br>
