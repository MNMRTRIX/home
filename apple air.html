<img src="mac air.png" width="300" height="200" align="right" >The MacBook Air is a line of Macintosh Ultrabook computers developed and manufactured by Apple Inc. It consists of a full-size keyboard, a machined aluminum case, and an thinly light structure. The Air is available in model sizes corresponding with screen length: 13.3in and 11.6in (23.78cm and 29.46cm respectively), with different specifications produced by Apple, and as of 2011, all models use solid-state drive storage and Intel Core i5 or i7 CPUs.<br>
In the current product line, the MacBook Air sits below the performance-range MacBook Pro and compared to the MacBook Retina, its features reflect different priorities. The Air was originally released as a premium ultraportable positioned above the previous MacBook.Since then, the Air has become Apple's entry-level laptop due to the MacBook's discontinuation in 2011, as well as lowered prices on subsequent iterations. In recent years, the Air has become the best-selling Macintosh computer and notebook, creating a line of ultraportable computers known as Ultrabooks.<br>
