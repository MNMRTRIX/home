<font face="Times New Romans" size=5><i>The HP ENVY series is a line of laptops and other products manufactured and sold by Hewlett-Packard. The ENVY competes with Dell XPS, and Sony VAIO. HP originally launched the line on October 15, 2009 with two high-performance models, the Envy 13 and the Envy 15. These models replaced the Voodoo Envy when HP and VoodooPC merged. After that, Hewlett-Packard expanded the series with the addition of the Envy 14 and Envy 17 models.<br>
In 2012, HP discontinued their traditional Envy 13, 14, 15 and 17 models by rebranding their Pavilion line of computers as the new Envy lineup. The new ENVY line has a starting price of $499 USD, and consists of the (rebranded Pavilion) Envy notebook line and the hybrid HP Envy x2. The rebranded Pavilion laptops continue with Beats Audio branded speakers and dedicated Nvidia graphic processors.
