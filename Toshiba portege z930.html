The Toshiba Portege Z930 series is a textbook example of a mainstream ultrabook. It's thin, it's light, its battery life is very good, and the entry-point model I tested, the Z935-P300, has enough processing performance for normal everydaycomputing.<p>
The Z935 is an inoffensive-looking laptop feat uring a magnesium alloy chassis with a brushed finish. People likely won't be craning their necks to see what laptop you're using at the coffee shop; it's one that blends in. On the other hand, the large chrome "Toshiba" on the lid will definitely let people know what brand it is. And if you like stickers, this system's got plenty: six on the palm rests and three on the bottom.<p>
