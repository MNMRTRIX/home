It Takes a lot to move the needle on laptop design. Hybrids have proved inventive over the past few years, with Yoga-style systems and the slick Surface Pro line redefining what a portable PC can look like. But for clamshells that don't swivel or twist, the flagship design may still be Apple's MacBook Air, which is already several years old.Dell now steps to the forefront with a laptop design tweak that feels so obvious, it's a wonder we haven't seen it before. Taking a cue from the past few generations of television design, the screen bezel, the outer border of glass and aluminum that surrounds the display, has been reduced to mere millimeters.<br> Dell calls it the infinity display, and describes it as virtually borderless.
It's not truly borderless , but the difference between this and the previous-generation XPS 13 is striking, and the same can be said comparing this to any other high-end 13-inch laptop or hybrid, from the MacBook Air to the Yoga 3 Pro . This allows the chassis to be smaller than other 13-inch laptops, fitting a 13-inch display into the same body size as an 11 or 12-inch laptop.
Our review model trades up from the entry-level Core i3 CPU and 128GB SSD flash drive configuration to a Core i5 and 256GB SSD respectively. Just as notably, the 1080p non-touch display model has been replaced with a 3,200x1,800 touchscreen . Premium territory to be sure, but the low starting price for the same excellent build quality and design makes it tempting for mid-price shoppers.
