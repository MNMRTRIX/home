<font face="Times New Romans" size=5><i><br>The MSI GE72 is a well-designed 17.3-inch gaming notebook. The laptop can run all modern games at medium to high details in its native FHD resolution. It produces higher frame rates than similarly equipped competitors, like the Asus GL771JW. However, the latter does not operate at maximum performance and offers lower power consumption and emissions. The GE72 is not very quiet but it is not excessively loud. The hardware of the model is great: a fast SSD serves as the system drive and the traditional HDD offers significant storage space. The keyboard is particularly good and provides an enjoyable typing experience. <br>
