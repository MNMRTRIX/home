The target group of Toshiba's Tecra A50 is clearly defined: It wants to be the perfect laptop for medium and larger companies with its matte Full HD screen, a whole range of security features, and both a SmartCard and ExpressCard slot.<p>
The predecessor Tecra R950 already reaped in impressive results, but a few points were ultimately deducted for the insufficient cooling and omitted graphics switching. The A50 is now to follow in its footsteps and fix exactly these points. However, Toshiba has made a few cutbacks. Instead of an Intel Core i7, the buyer now has to live with an Intel Core i5-4300M. In return, Nvidia's Optimus allows disabling the external GeForce GT 730M graphics card. In this review we want to find out whether these modifications are enough to make the Tecra A50 the ideal work machine for medium and larger companies.<p>
