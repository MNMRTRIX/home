The MacBook Pro is a line of Macintosh portable computers introduced in January 2006 by Apple Inc., now in its third generation. Replacing the PowerBook G4, the MacBook Pro was the second model to be announced in the Apple–Intel transition, after the iMac. It is the high-end model of the MacBook family and is currently produced with 13- and 15-inch screens. A 17-inch version was available for sale in April 2006.<br>
The first generation MacBook Pro appeared externally similar to the PowerBook G4, but used the Intel Core processors instead of PowerPC G4 chips. The 15-inch model was introduced first, in January 2006; the 17-inch model followed in April. Both received several updates and Core 2 Duo processors later that year.<br>
