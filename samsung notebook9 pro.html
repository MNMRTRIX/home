Computer design trend I've been enjoying lately is thse growing number of laptops that
fit big 15-inch screens into relatively thin, light bodies. For many years, a 13-inch laptop,
such as the MacBook Air or Dell XPS 13, was as big as you dared go in screen size for
a system intended for regular travel. Any bigger than that, and the laptop would inevitably
be a 5-pound-plus monster that would weigh down your shoulder bag. We've all seen on the
go office warriors dragging themselves, slump-shouldered, across the street -- no one wants
to be that guy.<br>
The 15-inch Samsung Notebook 9 is a key new example of a bigger screen in a smaller
it includes a current-gen Intel Core i7 processor, a big 256GB solid state hard drive, and 8GB
of RAM -- that's a very reasonable price for this semi-premiumconfiguration.The display is a 
non-touch full HD (1,920x1,080) gets a 4K-resolution touch version.<p>
