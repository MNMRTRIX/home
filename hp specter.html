Ever since HP released the Spectre x360 the company has been clearly putting a greater emphasis on design and top-of-the-line materials. It's evident that this philosophy has come to all of HP's machines, from the thinning Envy line to even its budget Pavilion line, which are now painted with a tennis shoe-inspired design.<br>
Now HP has released the Spectre, its most luxurious laptop yet, complete with gold bling and carbon fiber. The 13-inch Ultrabook also claims to be the world's thinnest notebook, while being the first laptop of this thinness (0.41 inches) to offer Intel Core i5 and i7 processors – a step up from the Intel Core M-powered MacBook.<br>
